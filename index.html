        <p>Firstly, I was inspired by the upcoming Halloween holiday. However, I'm not big on horror; in fact, spiders are about as much scare as I can take, so I decided to make a game with a more cute Halloween vibe.</p>
        <p>I also decided to lean into the idea of trick OR treat. Whenever we think about it, we always forget the trick aspect of the trick or treat. I thought, wouldn't it be fun to make a game where you can go virtual trick-or-treating (especially since no one can go trick or treating in person this year) that incorporates the "trick" into the game?</p>
        <p>Also I thought the concept of an adorable grave-robbing ghost was pretty funny.</p>

        <p>Use the arrow keys to navigate around the graveyard, and 'a' to unlock the trick or treat within each headstone.</p>
        <p>Watch out! If it's a trick, you'll have to run away until the trick goes off the screen.</p>
